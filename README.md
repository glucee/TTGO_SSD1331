# TTGO_SSD1331

SSD1331 library for TTGO T2 on Platformio IDE

## TTGO T2

TTGO T2 is a small PCB containing ESP32, SSD1331 and microSD reader, which is super useful for IoT development.

## Why ?
TTGO library provides a [SSD1331 library](https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-T2-SSD1331-SD/tree/master/lib) but it doesn't support string writting. I have done a research on [Adafruit SSD1331 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-SSD1331-OLED-Driver-Library-for-Arduino) and adapted it to support TTGO.

## Platformio
Platformio is simple and fast to use, it can config libraries and board easily in IoT development.
